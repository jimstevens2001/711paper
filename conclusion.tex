\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we described the BitTorrent protocol simulator we created
to study the utility of better global knowledge of rarest pieces in a
BitTorrent swarm. With this simulator, we showed that for healthy swarms,
knowledge about the state of the entire swarm  does not make a difference,
but for unhealthy swarms
with no seeds, that knowledge can help prevent the swarm from losing
pieces.  We then propose a gossip protocol to allow BitTorrent nodes to
communicate knowledge on the current state of the entire swarm to all of the 
nodes in the swarm and demonstrated
that it allows similar results to omniscient knowledge. We also
analyzed the overhead of the gossip protocol and proposed an alternative
gossip protocol to help swarms stay alive when seeders are willing to
be slightly altruistic.
