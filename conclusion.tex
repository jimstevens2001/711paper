\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we described the BitTorrent protocol simulator we created
to study the utility of better global knowledge of rarest pieces in a
BitTorrent swarm. With this simulator, we showed that for healthy swarms,
global knowledge does not make a difference, but for unhealthy swarms
with no seeds, global knowledge can help prevent the swarm from losing
pieces.  We then propose a gossip protocol to allow BitTorrent nodes to
allow more global knowledge to be known by the nodes and demonstrated
that it allows similar results to the perfect global knowledge. We also
analyzed the overhead of the gossip protocol and proposed an alternative
gossip protocol to help swarms stay alive when seeders are willing to
be slightly altruistic.
