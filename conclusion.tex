\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we described the BitTorrent protocol simulator we created to study how files 
propagate throughout a swarm. We used the simulator to study local versus global knowledge
in BitTorrent and found situations in which the local view is insufficient to provide 
optimal performance. We then propose a gossip protocol to allow BitTorrent nodes to
allow more global knowledge to be known by the nodes. Finally, we studied the effects
of the gossip protocol on swarm performance and demonstrated that, in certain important cases,
gossip can improve swarm performance.
