\section{Gossip Protocol}

Based on the results of our standard BitTorrent swarm study, we have
decided to focus our gossip protocol on interest messages to allow
nodes beyond the current set of peers to know if a node is looking for
a particular piece. This is particularly helpful for the situation in
which a node joins the swarm with a partially completed set of pieces
and has a difficult time finding peers with the rest of the pieces it
needs.

Note: We are still in the process of implementing the Gossip system, so
we cannot complete this section at the current time.
