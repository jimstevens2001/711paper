\section{Standard BitTorrent Swarm Study}

This section is not complete yet. We have completed coding the simulator
and finished debugging it for complex swarms the day this draft was completed. Initial
results have been collected that show local vs. global knowledge for various swarm sizes, but
were not ready to put into the report at the time of the deadline.

In this section, we will show several things:

\begin{itemize}
\item Local vs. Global rarest pieces at different time steps for various swarm sizes.
\item Study average completion time for nodes if they use local or global knowledge in their piece selection.
\item Study what happens when nodes with partial completed files join and attempt to find the last pieces (we feel this situation is very good for gossip).
\item Study what happens when seeds leave the swarm (with varying degrees of file completion among the leechers) to see if gossip can extend the lifetime of the swarm.
\end{itemize}
