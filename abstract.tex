The BitTorrent protocol is a popular peer-to-peer algorithm that is able to 
transfer large files efficeintly over the internet. One of major
downsides of this protocol is that the torrents are often only avaible
for a relatively limited time. This is because often after a certain
amount of time has elapsed there are no longer any nodes in the
network who possess certain pieces of the file. This work
investigates ways of extending the lifetime of a torrent by
intellegently selecting which pieces to download first based on global
information regarding the rarest pieces in the network. To accomplish
this global view of the swarm we propose the addition of gossip
messages to the BitTorrent protocol which propegate information on the
rarest pieces. Our results show that this method is able to improve
the piece selection of nodes thereby creating addtional copies of
critically rare pieces. In addition, we also find several other
important applications of the gossip messages that can be leveraged to
extend the life of the torrent.
